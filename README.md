# la-twitter
A list of all Twitter accounts associated with the City and County of Los Angeles.

## Introduction
This project is modeled after Code For Pittsburgh's [citytwitter](https://github.com/CodeForPittsburgh/citytwitter).  Twitter remains a useful civic tool that gives the public direct access to public officials, departments, and various municipal authorities.  This project will attempt to catalgue current handles and will need regular updating as local leaders change over time.
